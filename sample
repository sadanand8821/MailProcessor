Slide 2: Problem Statement / Current State

Business Context
	•	Our company maintains a vast and complex codebase spread across multiple GitHub repositories.
	•	Currently, we use GitHub Copilot to assist developers, but it can process only up to 5 files at a time.
	•	New developers face steep learning curves, spending significant time to become productive.
	•	Senior developers and code reviewers invest considerable effort assisting newcomers and understanding code changes.

Problem Statement
	•	Limitations of Current Tools:
	•	GitHub Copilot’s file processing limit restricts its effectiveness in large codebases.
	•	It struggles to provide context across multiple files or modules beyond its limit.
	•	Inefficient Onboarding:
	•	New team members struggle to navigate and comprehend the existing codebase.
	•	Time-Consuming Code Reviews:
	•	Lack of holistic context slows down the review process for code changes.
	•	Knowledge Silos:
	•	Critical code insights are trapped within individual team members.
	•	Reduced Productivity:
	•	Developers spend excessive time searching for code snippets or documentation.

Slide 3: Purpose / Opportunity Statement

Data Collection and Preprocessing
	•	Objective: Transform our entire codebase into an accessible and searchable knowledge repository without file limit constraints.
	•	Chunking Strategy:
	•	Break code into logical units such as classes, functions, and modules.
	•	Group related code segments (e.g., authentication, utilities, database interactions).
	•	Utilize Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to parse code structures precisely.
	•	Tokenize code while preserving syntax and semantics.
	•	Ensure each chunk fits within the language model’s token limit for efficient processing.

Advanced Retrieval Algorithms
	•	Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant code snippets across the entire codebase.
	•	Generate semantic embeddings using transformer models for accurate similarity searches.
	•	Utilize context-aware retrieval to provide meaningful assistance.

Opportunities
	•	Efficiency Improvements:
	•	Overcome the limitations of GitHub Copilot by providing context across the entire codebase.
	•	Accelerate onboarding of new developers.
	•	Productivity Gains:
	•	Reduce time spent searching for information.
	•	Enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.

Slide 4: Solution / Desired State

Real-Time Code Retrieval
	•	Provide instant access to relevant code snippets and documentation from the entire codebase.
	•	Support natural language queries to search effectively without file limitations.

Context-Aware Suggestions
	•	Offer suggestions based on the developer’s current task or code context across multiple files and modules.
	•	Assist in code completion, bug fixing, and implementing features with a holistic view.

Adaptability and Continuous Learning
	•	Learn from user interactions to improve response accuracy over time.
	•	Automatically update with changes in the codebase through continuous integration.

Model Interpretability and Transparency
	•	Provide explanations for suggestions to build trust with users.
	•	Ensure developers understand the reasoning behind the assistance provided.

Scalability and Deployment
	•	Design to handle large and growing codebases beyond the limitations of current tools.
	•	Seamlessly integrate with existing development tools and workflows.

Slide 5: Solution / Desired State (continued)

Evaluation Metrics
	•	Onboarding Time Reduction: Decrease in time taken for new developers to contribute effectively.
	•	Productivity Increase: Measure reduction in time spent searching for code or documentation.
	•	Code Review Efficiency: Assess improvements in the speed and quality of code reviews.
	•	User Satisfaction: Collect feedback on the assistant’s usefulness and accuracy.
	•	Code Quality Metrics: Monitor adherence to coding standards and reduction in bugs.

Outcome
	•	Empowers Developers: Enhances their ability to understand and contribute to the codebase without file constraints.
	•	Facilitates Collaboration: Bridges gaps between team members and departments.
	•	Improves Code Quality: Encourages best practices and reduces errors.
	•	Boosts Productivity: Allows developers to focus on creative problem-solving.

Slide 6: Technical Architecture / Workflows

Workflow Stages:
	1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing
	•	Code Parsing and Tokenization:
	•	Use parsers and tokenizers to dissect code into classes, functions, and logical blocks.
	•	Utilize ASTs for accurate code structure representation.
	•	Chunking Strategy:
	•	Break code into manageable chunks based on functionality, not limited by the number of files.
	•	Ensure chunks are within the language model’s token limit.
	•	Include relevant comments and documentation.
	2.	Embedding Generation
	•	Generate semantic embeddings for each code chunk using transformer models.
	•	Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
	3.	Similarity Search and Retrieval
	•	Implement similarity search algorithms to retrieve relevant code snippets.
	•	Use user query embeddings to find the most relevant code chunks across the entire codebase.
	4.	Context Assembly and Response Generation
	•	Combine retrieved code snippets to form coherent responses.
	•	Use language models like Llama for natural language explanations.
	•	Incorporate contextual information from the user’s query.
	5.	Feedback and Learning
	•	Collect user feedback on responses.
	•	Apply reinforcement learning to refine model performance.
	•	Continuously update embeddings and code chunks as the codebase evolves.
	6.	Scalability and Deployment
	•	Design the system to handle large and growing codebases without file limitations.
	•	Ensure smooth integration with existing development environments, complementing tools like GitHub Copilot.
